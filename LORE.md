## The Well
The Well hums somewhere below everything else.  
Nobody built it; we just tap it.  
It remembers nothing and keeps running even when you don’t.

The Well hosts every Pit.  
Each Pit flickers to life when someone starts it, and vanishes when everyone bails.  
No logs. No history. Just the sync.

---

## The Pit
A Pit is a pocket of shared state — a dirty little moment where people collide in real time.  
You start a pit when you want to draw, write, stream, or break something together.  
You jump into a pit when someone drops you a token.  
You bail when you’ve had enough.

Pits aren’t owned.  
They’re lived in.

---

## The PitSlug
Every pit carries a **PitSlug** — six letters of identity, ugly and disposable.  
It’s short enough to shout across a room or scrawl on a wall.  
Slugs don’t prove anything.  
They just tell you where the noise is.

Example: `4QZ8RK`

## The PitToken
A **PitToken** is the actual pass — the velvet-rope credential that gets you in.  
It’s the link you drop when you want company, a signed fragment that whispers _trust me once_.  
Tokens expire, burn, and vanish.

Example:
```
https://thewell.local/pit/4QZ8RK#eyJhbGciOi...
```

If you’ve got the token, you’re past the bouncer.

## The Link
When you drop a link, you’re not inviting — you’re exposing.  
A link is a whisper into the noise:  
> “There’s a pit. Jump in if you can find it.”

It’s not social. It’s survival.

---

## The Ritual
1. **Start a Pit.**  
   The Well breathes; the slug is born.
2. **Drop a Token.**  
   Someone gets past the rope.
3. **Jump In.**  
   You sync, drift, merge, collide.
4. **Bail.**  
   The Pit collapses. The Well forgets.

## The Ethos
No accounts.  
No persistence.  
No promises.

The Well doesn’t care who you are.  
It only cares that you sync.

> _Start a pit. Drop a token. Jump in. Bail when it gets weird._
